This project is for excercise push and pull commits between local repository and remote repository.
To include GitHub into my Git workflow, I need to understand the relationship between local and remote repositories for a project.

How to push commits from local repository to remote repository
1. Navigate to the top-level directory of the project.
2. Run this git command : $ git push origin main
    > this command is used to push commits from local repository to remote repository named "origin".
    > and main means it will push commits to main branch of remote repository.
